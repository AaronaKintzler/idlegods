-Shrine flush out
-Ascend hovers over and tells you what level diety you are. First 3 => Nothingness,Spirit,Kami. Determine effects. 



Large:
- Start by giving 1 prayer per second. Make other things use prayers. Take this and develop the Core loop. Spirit, prayers, intensity, souls, time?

-Prestige moves you over 4 screens to mount olympus and tells you Posiden will not allow it. 

-Moving to next area (abstract town down to a button?)

-Saving the game so it doesn't restart on every launch.
